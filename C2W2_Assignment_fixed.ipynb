        "Welcome to this assignment! As in the previous week, you will be using the famous `cats vs dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities, more so this time around since Keras provides excellent support for augmenting image data.\n",

        "You might wonder why the training threshold to pass this assignment is significantly lower compared to last week's assignment. Image augmentation does help with overfitting but usually this comes at the expense of requiring more training time. To keep the training time reasonable, the same number of epochs as in the previous assignment are kept. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, as an optional exercise you are encouraged to try training for more epochs and to achieve really good training and validation accuracies."
